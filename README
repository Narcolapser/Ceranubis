Ceranubis is a minimal cross-platform centeralized distributed computing system. It was devised and created by myself, Toben "Littlefoot" Archer, for Dr. Arnet of Northwestern College of Orange City Iowa as a simple system for the use of boosting the speed at which Dr. Arnet can do his research.

Current version: 0.7

Ceranubis runs off of 3 python files and a PostgreSQL RDMBS. The 3 python files are the Client library which allows users access to the system. The Node script which is responsible for the actual execution of a user's code. It fetches the code, operates on it, and returns the result. Each node will bind itself to a project until that project has been completed. The final file is the Dispatch script. Dispatch is responsible for maintaining the nodes. the current system has each node bind to a project until there is no more on that project to do. at which point the node process terminates, dispatch recognizes this and creates a new node process which will bind itself to a different project.

Todo:
	Create a web interface for the server to monitor progress and general maintenance purposes.
	Create a web interface for each node for monitor and maintenance.
	Make the system self aware for statistical tracking.
	Make some unit tests.
