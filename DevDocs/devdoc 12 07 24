working on database stuff today, so a lot of random snipets are going to find their way into this doc.

connnecting to the database:
db = postgresql.open("pq://ceranubis:raidersrow@localhost/ceranubis")
db = postgresql.open("pq://user:password@host/name_of_database")

Create the projects table:
'CREATE TABLE projects (projectID integer PRIMARY KEY, completed boolean, code text, target text); ALTER TABLE projects OWNER TO ceranubis; GRANT SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT ON TABLE projects TO public;'

So I was banging my head trying to figure out why I couldn't get my inserts to work. simple answer: strings are delimited by ' not by ".

inserting into projects:
db.execute("INSERT INTO projects VALUES(3,false,'import math\n\ndef sqrt(val):\n\treturn math.sqrt(val)','sqrt')")
db.execute("INSERT INTO projects VALUES(PID,status,'CODE!','target')")

reading from projects
g = db.prepare("SELECT * FROM projects WHERE completed= $1")
a = g(False)

Create the arguments table:
CREATE TABLE arguments
(
   ArgID integer NOT NULL, 
   ProjID integer NOT NULL, 
   Arg text NOT NULL, 
   Result text, 
   CONSTRAINT args_pk PRIMARY KEY (ArgID, ProjID)
) 
WITH (
  OIDS = FALSE
)
;
ALTER TABLE arguments OWNER TO ceranubis;
GRANT SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT ON TABLE arguments TO public;
