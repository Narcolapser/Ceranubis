so, I've almost got the basics of the Nodes side done. I've decided that what I'm going to do is have the cNode.py file be that which runs code, and then I'll have another file, yet to be named, which just makes new processes of cNode running. this gets it so I can run on multi-core processors as well as simplifying a couple other things. again, keeping this as simple as possible.
